# Constructors and Initialization

<div class="note note-version">
	The framework base classes, as described below have been deprecated in 1.2
	and will be removed in 2.0. Most of their features have been extracted into
	their classes, i.e. filters into <code>aop\Filters</code>, auto-configuration
	into <code>core\AutoConfigurable</code>.
</div>

The base class in li3's hierarchy, `lithium\core\Object`, forms the basic logic for all of the concrete classes in the framework. This class defines several conventions for how classes in li3 should be structured:

 * Universal constructor
 * Object configuration
 * Object initialization
 * Filtering
 * Testing utilities

## Universal Constructor

The `Object` class features a unified constructor, which all classes share. The function takes a single argument, `$config` which is an array of properties that is automatically saved to the `$_config` property of the current object. This approach allows for short constructor signatures and creates a unified way to override object configuration, or set object defaults when subclassing.

## Object Configuration & Initialization

Constructor logic should be kept to a minimum. One of the last steps in the unified constructor is to call the objects `init()` method. Here's where you do your heavy lifting. 

If you need to manipulate an object in its un-initialized state, pass `false` as the value to the `init` key to the constructor. This prevents `init()` from running, and is especially handy when building test cases.

```php
namespace app/extensions;

use lithium\net\http\Service;

class Foo extends \lithium\core\Object {
	public $service;
	
	public function __construct(array $config = []) {
		$defaults = [
			'foo' => 'bar'
		];
		parent::__construct($config + $defaults);
	}
	
	public function _init() {
		parent::_init();
		$this->service = new Service();
	}
	
	public function baz() {
		echo $this->_config['foo'];
	}
} 
```

```php
use app\extensions\Foo;

$foo = new Foo();
$foo->baz();               // 'bar'

$foo2 = new Foo([
	'foo' => '123'
]);
$foo2->baz();              // '123'

$foo3 = new Foo([
	'init' => 'false'
]);
get_class($foo3->service);  // PHP Warning...
get_class($foo->service);  // 'lithium\net\http\Service'
```
