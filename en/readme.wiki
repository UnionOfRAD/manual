# Lithium: The Definitive Guide

So you're interested in writing tight apps with the latest RAD techniques? Welcome to Lithium, the most RAD framework for PHP.

This set of guides is meant for PHP developers trying to get a handle on what Lithium can do, and—more importantly—what it can do for _you_. This set of guides is meant to give you a world-class tour of the Lithium framework. Once you're done, you'll know how to do MVC, data access, authentication, authorization, validation, internationalization, layouts, and unit testing. In short, you'll learn how all about Rapid Application Development, Lithium style.

Enough talk. Let's get started.
