# Lithium on Litespeed

## Basic Setup

In order to provide Lithium applications with clean URLs, Lithium ships with a set of `.htaccess` files for use with Apache, which will handle URL rewriting.  Litespeed supports `.htaccess` files, so it should work similar to Apache.

Point Litespeed's Document Root to your application's `webroot` directory, which contains the `.htaccess` file with the rewrite rules.

## Production Setup

In production, it is recommended that you set `Allow Override` to `None` and instead place the rewrite rules in the `Rewrite` section of your Virtual Host in Litespeed's control panel.

In the `Rewrite` section, set `Enable Rewrite` to `Yes` and paste the following into the `Rewrite Rules` section:

{{{
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !favicon.ico$
RewriteRule . index.php [QSA,L]
}}}

Note: the `?url=$1` appended to the rewritten url in the `.htaccess` and Apache config examples is unnecessary.  Litespeed sets the appropriate environment vars so Lithium can determine the requested path without needing to add a var to the query string.

## Path Issue and Fix

In order to determine the correct base url path for the app and for assets like scripts, css, and images, Lithium first looks to the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` server/environment variable.  The lsapi used by Litespeed to interact with PHP seems to set `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` to the `REQUEST_URI` rather than the actual PHP file that is handling the request.  This causes Lithium to set the base path incorrectly.  To work around the issue, add the following to the top of your app's `config/bootstrap.php` file:

{{{
/** fix rewrite issue with Litespeed **/
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] = str_replace('\\', '/', str_replace(
	$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'], '', $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']
));
$_ENV['PHP_SELF'] = $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];
}}}
