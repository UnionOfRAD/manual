# MongoDB Setup

MongoDB is a _document-oriented_ or _non-relational_ database. Document-oriented databases have many advantages over more traditional relational databases, including high performance and much simpler scalability. Many developers also like its schema-less nature, allowing the app to add fields to records as needed.

It is important to understand, however, that MongoDB is _not_ a replacement for relational databases. Relational databases maintain the advantage of much more powerful queriesâ€”especially when it comes to complex relations.

With that said, we'll leave it to the MongoDB folks to explain [how to set up MongoDB itself](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Getting+Started).

Once you've got Mongo itself installed, follow the directions below, depending on your operating system:

## *NIX

For MongoDB + PHP goodness, you'll need the Mongo PECL module. For most *NIX systems, this is as easy as:

{{{
$ sudo pecl install mongo
}}}

Now add the following line to your php.ini:
{{{
	extension=mongo.so
}}}

That's it! Restart your web server, and you're done!

## Windows

The precompiled driver is available for VC8 and VC9.

Builds for each release are available on [ GitHub](http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver/downloads). They are all built for PHP 5.3, as PHP 5.2 is no longer supported with VC9.

Binaries for the latest code are also available:

    * VC8 Thread-Safe
    * VC8 Non-Thread-Safe
    * VC9 Thread-Safe
    * VC9 Non-Thread-Safe

Once you've identified the correct version for your system:

 * Download and extract the .zip file. Make sure PHP version_ matches the version of PHP you are running (e.g., if you are running PHP 5.3.2, download the driver for PHP 5.3).
 * Copy php_mongo.dll to your PHP extensions directory (see "extension_dir" in php.ini).
 * Add the following line to your php.ini:
{{{
extension=php_mongo.dll
}}}

Restart your web server, and you're done!
