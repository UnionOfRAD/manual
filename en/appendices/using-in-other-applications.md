# Using Lithium in external applications

Because Lithium is so flexible, you can bootstrap the core framework into any application environment, and use just the features you need.  First, make sure you have installed Lithium properly.

To use Lithium classes, simply load the class that manages libraries (`lithium\core\Libraries`), and register the Lithium library itself, as follows:

{{{
include "/path/to/classes/libraries/lithium/core/Libraries.php";

lithium\core\Libraries::add('lithium');
}}}

Note that `"path/to/classes"` may be relative to your include path.

## Integrating with CakePHP

CakePHP provides a convenient place to add this configuration: `app/config/bootstrap.php`.  Additionally, if you'd like to intermingle Lithium classes (models and controllers) with their CakePHP counterparts, you can add the following (again, to `bootstrap.php`):

{{{
define("LITHIUM_APP_PATH", dirname(__DIR__));
lithium\core\Libraries::add('app', array('bootstrap' => false));
}}}

This correctly locates your app directory in Lithium's class loader, and suppresses `app`'s default bootstrap file.  You may now import your namespaced app classes in your CakePHP classes, and use Lithium and CakePHP models and other classes in parallel. Note that `LITHIUM_APP_PATH` should be defined _before_ `Libraries.php` is included.

## Defining data connections

If you plan on using Lithium's data layer, you need to create `connections.php` inside `LITHIUM_APP_PATH/config`.  If you are defining your connections dynamically, this file can be empty. By convention, however, this file is used to configure your database and web service connections.  See [`lithium\data\Connections`](http://lithify.me/docs/lithium/data/Connections) for more information on how to do this.
